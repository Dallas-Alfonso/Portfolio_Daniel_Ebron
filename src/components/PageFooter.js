          "Daniel and I both worked on the finance team, though in different facets. Our team was small, so it was very obvious if someone stood out as a hard worker. Daniel took every challenge as an opportunity to learn, and I witnessed how quickly he would learn new things. Daniel is a great, talented, and intelligent person to have on your team and a pleasure to work with, too."

          "What stroke me the most about Daniel was his willingness to learn and his adaptability. Within a short time he would take control over any new project assigned to him. Daniel never refused a project as long as he knew that there was someone he could learn from or research. In fact during his time at the Garden City Group he wore many hats, accountant, accounts payable, billing, bank reconciliation and cash management expert. His growth has been tremendous during his time here at GCG and I wholeheartedly recommend him to any company. I am sad to see him go because I relied on him a lot but I know that he will excel at his new job and be an asset to any employer."
